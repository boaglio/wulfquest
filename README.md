# Wulf Quest

A Java game: you are a ranger, alone in a 256-room jungle, looking for four
pieces of a broken amulet. Large animals guard them. Smaller things want to
kill you on the way. Flowers grow that will make you fast, or slow, or
invert your sense of direction. And somewhere out there is the Wulf, which
cannot be killed and does not lose interest.

A clean-room homage to the flip-screen jungle mazes of 1984, built from
scratch with original artwork, original audio, and no third-party game
engine.

## Status

**Milestone M0 complete** — project skeleton, build, and the no-binary-assets
gate. There is no playable game yet. Next up is M1 (data layer and a window).
The full plan lives in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) §24.

## Build and run

Needs a JDK 21+ and Maven.

```bash
mvn -q verify          # compile, test, validate all data, run the CI gates
mvn -q exec:java       # run
mvn -q package && java -jar target/wulfquest-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrows / WASD | Walk (8 directions) |
| Space / Z | Swing the sabre |
| P | Pause |
| Escape | Quit |

A period key layout (`Q`/`A`/`O`/`P` to move, `M` to swing) can be selected
from the title screen.

## How it is built

- **Java 21, Java2D, no engine.** A 320×256 indexed-colour framebuffer
  scaled by an integer factor. A fixed 50 Hz simulation with fixed-point
  integer maths, so a run is bit-for-bit reproducible from its seed.
- **JSON files are the database.** Every creature, speed, timing, score,
  palette entry, sound, and string lives in `data/`, schema-validated at
  boot. No game constant exists in the Java source.
- **The artwork is text.** Every sprite is a JSON grid of palette-index
  characters, so all the art in this game is authored, reviewable in a diff,
  and ours. The build fails if any binary image or audio file appears in the
  repository.
- **The audio is synthesised.** Square waves and noise, generated at
  runtime, in the spirit of a one-bit speaker.
