# Wulf Quest

A Java game: you are a ranger, alone in a 256-room jungle, looking for four
pieces of a broken amulet. Large animals guard them. Smaller things want to
kill you on the way. Flowers grow that will make you fast, or slow, or
invert your sense of direction. And somewhere out there is the Wulf, which
cannot be killed and does not lose interest.

A clean-room homage to the flip-screen jungle mazes of 1984, built from
scratch with original artwork, original audio, and no third-party game
engine.

## Status

**Milestone M5 complete** — and something is hunting you. Thirteen kinds of
creature fill the jungle by its landscape, and now there is the Wulf: it howls
at the edge of the screen, gives you less than a second, then comes — faster
than you, unkillable, following you from room to room. The sabre only buys you
a moment. Terrain is your friend. There is no quest yet (M6). The full plan lives in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) §24.

```bash
./run.sh                   # play, starting in 8,10
./run.sh --seed 42         # replay the same creatures in every room
./run.sh --room 3,4        # start somewhere else
./run.sh --dev             # K kills Vale, M shows collision, H calls the Wulf
./run.sh --record run.json # save the first game as a replay
./run.sh --browse          # the room browser: arrows, [ ] or PgUp/PgDn, M
```

## Build and run

Needs a JDK 21+ and Maven.

```bash
./run.sh               # build if needed, then play
./run.sh --scale 3     # options are passed through to the game
./run.sh --headless    # load and validate the data, then exit
./run.sh --test        # full verify (tests + CI gates) first
./run.sh --help
```

`run.sh` is a convenience wrapper; Maven is the build:

```bash
mvn -q verify          # compile, test, validate all data, run the CI gates
mvn -q exec:java       # run
mvn -q package && java -jar target/wulfquest-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Editing anything under `data/` takes effect on the next `./run.sh` with no
rebuild — the game reads the working tree's `data/` directly.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Arrows / WASD | Walk (8 directions) |
| Space / Z | Swing the sabre |
| P | Pause |
| Escape | Quit |

A period key layout (`Q`/`A`/`O`/`P` to move, `M` to swing, `H` to pause) is
defined in `data/config/input.json` — set `"active": "period"`. A title-screen
switch arrives with the title screen in M8.

## How it is built

- **Java 21, Java2D, no engine.** A 320×256 indexed-colour framebuffer
  scaled by an integer factor. A fixed 50 Hz simulation with fixed-point
  integer maths, so a run is bit-for-bit reproducible from its seed.
- **JSON files are the database.** Every creature, speed, timing, score,
  palette entry, sound, and string lives in `data/`, schema-validated at
  boot. No game constant exists in the Java source.
- **The artwork is text.** Every sprite is a JSON grid of palette-index
  characters, so all the art in this game is authored, reviewable in a diff,
  and ours. The build fails if any binary image or audio file appears in the
  repository.
- **The audio is synthesised.** Square waves and noise, generated at
  runtime, in the spirit of a one-bit speaker.

## Repository layout
